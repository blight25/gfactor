We describe our atomic fluorescence calculator, _gfactor_, that makes use of publicly available APIs provided by NASA, NOAA, and NIST to calculate the photon emission efficiency in a solar radiation field, colloquially known as a _g_-factor, given a particular heliocentric distance and velocity by the user. This Python package was designed for use in cometary science, where the wide range of applicable heliocentric distances and velocities can drastically affect the fluorescence efficiency via the Swings effect. However, there are many astrophysical applications where accurate determination of the fluorescence efficiency is required. 

While there are many published articles that contain tabulated fluorescence efficiencies, to date there has not been a software package that ingests that allows for the user to customize the parameters and query the high-quality curated datasets that contain atomic parameters and solar spectral irradiance data. Standard practice in the field has been to pick either a solar minimum or solar maximum representative spectrum, whichever best represents the Sun's activity level on the day of observation, and calculate the _g_-factor for the atomic species of interest with that spectrum. However, due to the large volume of cometary data taken in the last 50 years with a range of UV assets, where the change in solar flux can drastically change the fluorescence efficiency, we have decided to implement an API call to the NASA/NOAA/LASP LiSiRD Database, where solar spectral data can be retrieved directly. This allows the user of _gfactor_ to input a specific date, heliocentric distance and velocity, and retrieve a relevant solar spectrum for the day of observation that can be used to calculate fluorescence efficiencies.
