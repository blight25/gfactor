We describe our atomic fluorescence calculator, _gfactor_, that makes use of publicly available APIs provided by NASA, NOAA, and NIST to calculate the photo emission efficiency, colloquially known as a _g_-factor, given a particular heliocentric distance and velocity by the user. This Python package was designed for use in cometary science, where the wide range of applicable heliocentric distances and velocities can drastically affect the fluorescence efficiency via the Swings effect.
